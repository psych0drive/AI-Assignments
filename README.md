**Assignment 1** 
In this assignment, *8 Queen Problem* is being solved by the use of UCS. The valid states are explored, and then mapped to an empty board.
The program will find the possible solutions and print them in the terminal. Here we consider the cost of every move is same equal to 1.

To Run : Open the code in an IDE,  compile/build -> Run.

**Assignment 2**
In this assignment, *8 Queen Problem* is being solved by the use of A*. The valid states are explored, and then mapped to an empty board.
The program will find the possible solutions and print them in the terminal. Here we consider the cost of every move is same equal to 1.

To Run : Open the code in an IDE,  compile/build -> Run.

**Assignment 3**
In this assignment, we run the code for 1000 generations in order to find the fittest member by Genetic Algorithm. Number of students and generations
are fixed by using #define. To change them, make edits in the code at the beginning. In the end, the marks and group of the students is printed.

To Run : Open the code in an IDE,  compile/build -> Run.

**Assignment 4**
In this assignment, we design a Game of Sticks, where each player picks up 1-3 sticks, and the player picking up the last stick is the loser. Choose number of sticks
among (14,21,53), and then choose computer vs computer or player vs player.

To Run : Open the code in an IDE,  compile/build -> Run.
